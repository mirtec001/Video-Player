C# Video player with VLC library


<h1>
  Notes:
</h1>

Media folder must be in the same location as the executable.
Still working on a way to track the windows a better way to close and reopen them.<br />
Also you'll need the plugins folder from the VLC repos. <br />

Please comment and submit patches.
